            And so ... it's a guide to killing a beleth on one server (rpg-club).
            <h3>what do we need on the first hike? Let's see:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>made the quest to enter at HB</li>
                <li>quest items
                    <ol>
                        <li> Ranku's Blueprint <br><img src="images/qitems.PNG" alt=""> </li>
                        <li>Demon Prince's Blueprint <img src="images/qitems1.PNG" alt=""> </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    map HB (not necessary)</li>

            </ol>
            <hr>
            after that we are looking for NPC Matras<br> <img src="images/Shot00034.jpg" class="nps" alt=""> ,<br> and
            FINISHED the quest “Matras' Curiosity”
            <br>
            <h3> What else do you need on the hike? =></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>range skill or bow (any)</li>
                <li>party (min 2 characters) to enter the tully, and the 2th character MUST BE near</li>
                <li>+2 more characters to make CC (min 4 characters for everything)</li>
                <li>be cool DD (I had enough claws + 12 and SK) or take your buff</li>
                <li>server item "Mob's Tekila" </li>
                <li>permission CL )</li>
            </ol>


            Now we can get through NPC Deltuva<br>
            <img src="images/Shot00037.jpg" class="nps" alt=""> <br>to the second tower (popularly: Tuli workshop,
            workshop or Tuli). Then through NPC Dorian <br>
            <img src="images/Shot00039.jpg" class="nps" alt=""><br> PL teleports party to tower (you must be in party
            and 2th character nearby), if you are weak
            use SD of BD.
            1st floor - immediately run to the TP's Pillar and press "up",
            2-4 floors, just press on the TP's Pillar
            5th floor labyrinth, we go according to the scheme and kill the RB (if he will be alive )and go to the
            TP<br>
            <img src="images/way.PNG" class="nps" alt=""> <br>then we just jump through the floors.
            On the roof you can kill Darion's RB and if you have a buff> 45min or have your own we go to the 3rd tower
            of the beleth (Tower of
            Naia) on
            the roof of the 3rd tower is "lock",<br>
            <img src="images/7ad98a4e0ccb.jpg" alt=""> <br>UNTIL APPEARANCE 4 MOBS! As soon as they appeared, we stop
            HITING and click "TP" on the near box . <br> If "the lock" is broken, we 'smoke' for 10 minutes + -. And
            then we hit again "the lock."
            <hr>
            After teleporting to tower 3, we run through the rooms, and beat the mobs. <br>If buff > 45min and
            you are strong you can leave 2th twin.
            <hr>
            Having reached the bottom(basement), where the "fountain" is, if there is a crystal, we make a party and a
            СС, geolocating all characters does not matter,
            teleports the current of those who are near the crystal, will help /channelinvite ( nickname's PL of another
            party) and fly to the epik.
            <br>
            If there isn't a crystal, we are looking for a rabbit and kill it. Sometimes it is a on the fountain's top
            and we can use only range skill or bow to get this rabbit.<br>
            Further mobs climb from the fountain:<br> 1st wave without attribute - disappear by themselves or you can
            kill it. <br>
            Then over beat the mobs of the 1st attribute. <br> As for me - we look at who climbs more :golems or lizards
            and
            kill who is more.
            <br> Then RB will appear, after killing him, a crystal will appear, and then made CC ...
